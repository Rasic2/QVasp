Potential Energy Surface (PES) plot is important in reaction mechanism research, and our :program:`QVasp` certainly support to plot PES with *various* data.

simple case
------------

A very simple reaction data like this (noted they are all relative energy):

.. code-block:: python

    data = [0, -0.09, 0.75, 0.06, 0.26, -2.46, -1.02, -1.58]

We can plot it by run the command like before:

.. code-block:: bash

    QVasp plot PES -j plot.json --save

And the figure like this:

.. image:: pes1.svg
   :align: center

The plot.json is like this:

.. code-block:: json

    {
     "data": [[0, -0.09, 0.75, 0.06, 0.26, -2.46, -1.02, -1.58]]
    }

.. note::
    **data** parament is a set of lines, so even if you have only one line, its type should be List[List[float]].

change style
-------------

By add a :code:`style="solid_curve"`, the figure can be changed like this:

.. image:: pes2.svg
   :align: center

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "data": [[[0, -0.09, 0.75, 0.06, 0.26, -2.46, -1.02, -1.58],["MS", "MS", "TS", "MS", "TS", "MS", "TS", "MS"]]],
      "style": "solid_curve"
    }

.. attention::
    For the "solid_curve" style, one need to specify the data belonging to a intermediate state (MS) of transition state (TS), so **data** parament' type now be List[List[List[float], List[str]]].

None value
-----------

If your data have :code:`None`, the :program:`QVasp` can work well.

for example,

.. code-block:: python

    data = [0, None, None, 0.06, None, None, 0.39, -1.51]

The plot figure is like this:

.. image:: pes3.svg
   :align: center

The plot.json is like this:

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "data": [[0, null, null, 0.06, null, null, 0.39, -1.51]]
    }

.. important::
    **Json** file can't recognize the None value, so we substitute the *None* as *null*.

multiple lines
---------------

If you want to compete different reaction pathway, data like below:

.. code-block:: python

    data = [[0, -0.09, 0.75, 0.06, 0.26, -2.46, -1.02, -1.58],
            [None, None, None, None, None, -2.46, -0.95, -1.66],
            [None, None, None, 0.06, None, None, 0.39, -1.51]]

The plot figure is like this:

.. image:: pes4.svg
   :align: center

The plot.json is like this:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "data" : [[0, -0.09, 0.75, 0.06, 0.26, -2.46, -1.02, -1.58],
                  [null, null, null, null, null, -2.46, -0.95, -1.66],
                  [null, null, null, 0.06, null, null, 0.39, -1.51]],
        "text_flag": false
    }

And we close the `text` by add :code:`text_flag = false`.

Here, you may known how to plot the PES with :program:`QVasp`, of course, it can do better in the future.
